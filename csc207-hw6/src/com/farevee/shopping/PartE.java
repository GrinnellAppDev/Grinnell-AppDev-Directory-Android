/*
 *  After MUCH struggle, I think I finally understand the relationships 
 *  between the classes and methods I've been working with.  
 *  BulkItem is a superclass of BulkContainer, which is its subclass. The
 *  reason for this type of inheritance is that because the BulkContainer
 *  is the same thing as BulkItem, only with a container wrapped around it.
 *  
 *  This means that we want methods that are all the same, but we also want
 *  to include one more field that will affect the methods.  This is 
 *  advantageous when methods are intended to work the same, but requires
 *  more or less fields (So the methods are altered slightly)
 *  
 *  As for Package versus ManyPackage, these do not necessarily follow one after
 *  another, as in a child-parent relationship, but ManyPackages do inherent all 
 *  the same methods, only with altered methods (and an additional field).
